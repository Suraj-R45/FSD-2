   - Learn how to set up and configure React Router in a single-page application (SPA) to enable client-side navigation without full page reloads.

2. Implementing Links and Navigation
   - Master the use of `<Link>` and `<NavLink>` components to create navigation elements that allow users to navigate between different routes without reloading the page.

3. Defining and Managing Routes
   - Understand how to define routes using route configurations, nested routes, and dynamic route parameters to create flexible and scalable routing structures in your application.

4. Route State and URL Parameters
   - Learn how to extract and utilize URL parameters and query strings to pass data between components and maintain application state based on the current route.

5. Programmatic Navigation and Route Guards
   - Develop skills in programmatically navigating users through routes using the `useNavigate` hook and implementing route protection mechanisms for authenticated access.
