# Experiment 1: SPA vs MPA

## Learning Outcomes

1. Understand Single Page Application (SPA) Architecture
   - Learn how SPAs load a single HTML page and dynamically update content using JavaScript without full page reloads
   - Understand client-side routing and how SPAs manage navigation between views

2. Understand Multi-Page Application (MPA) Architecture
   - Learn how MPAs use traditional server-side rendering with multiple HTML pages
   - Understand how MPAs handle navigation through traditional hyperlinks and server requests

3. Compare Performance Characteristics
   - Evaluate initial load time, subsequent navigation speed, and user experience differences between SPA and MPA
   - Understand caching strategies, bundle sizes, and how each architecture impacts performance metrics

4. Analyze Trade-offs and Use Cases
   - Identify scenarios where SPA architecture is optimal (e.g., real-time applications, interactive dashboards)
   - Identify scenarios where MPA architecture is optimal (e.g., content-heavy websites, SEO-critical applications)

5. Implement Best Practices for Each Architecture
   - Learn about state management, code splitting, and optimization techniques specific to SPAs
   - Learn about SEO considerations, server-side rendering, and scalability strategies for MPAs
