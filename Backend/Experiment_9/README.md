# Learning Outcomes

1. Understand the difference between basic, token-based, and JWT authentication.
2. Set up `flask_jwt_extended` in a Flask application and configure a secret key.
3. Generate JWTs using `create_access_token` and protect routes with `@jwt_required()`.
4. Extract the current user's identity from a JWT using `get_jwt_identity()`.
5. Recognize when JWTs are appropriate for stateless authentication and how to include additional claims if needed.
