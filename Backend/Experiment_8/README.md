# Experiment 8: Developing RESTful APIs with a Backend Framework

## Learning Outcomes



1. Explain RESTful principles – describe the architectural style of REST, including statelessness, resource-based modeling, and standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
2. Design API endpoints – plan and structure clear, consistent routes and resources using a backend framework, ensuring proper naming conventions and versioning.
3. Implement CRUD operations – build backend logic for creating, reading, updating, and deleting data through RESTful endpoints using framework features.
4. Handle requests and responses – process incoming data, validate inputs, manage errors, and return appropriate HTTP status codes and JSON payloads.
5. Integrate middleware and authentication – apply middleware for tasks like logging, parsing, and security, and implement basic authentication/authorization mechanisms in the API.
